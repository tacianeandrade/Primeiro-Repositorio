#Write a Python program to calculate the popularity of programming languages at a computer school.
#The program should receive a keystroke named by the person and the programming language that program.
#The program must provide an option menu between the three languages taught in the course: (1) C + +(2) Javaand (3) Python. 
#Create a dictionary to store each person and the value of their vote. At the end, print out how many votes each language got.


#Use data entry via the keyboard to ask the user to enter two numbers (int or decimal). 
#Your program should perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division 
#and square root operations first number entered and then display the result on the screen.
